## So what is a Pineapple

A WiFi Pineapple is a small but powerful device used by security professionals to test network vulnerabilities. It's basically a hacker’s Swiss Army knife. It works by **mimicking trusted WiFi networks, tricking nearby devices into connecting automatically.** Once connected, **all the traffic flowing between the device and the internet passes through the Pineapple,** allowing the user to intercept, analyze, or even manipulate the data. Originally built by Hak5, it’s a go-to tool for penetration testers simulating real-world attacks. This little thing is a constant reminder of how easily our devices can be fooled if we’re not paying attention.

## Why am I making my own?

The simplest answer is it's just really expensive; plus trying to explain to customs what this alien satelite of a box is would be an equally intresting time. Anyway I came across [xchwarze's pineapple cloner](https://github.com/xchwarze/wifi-pineapple-cloner) via a reddit post and it was almost like divine intervention. So, after extensive searching I found the ["Glocal Net GR-MT300N-V2"](https://www.amazon.co.jp/-/en/GR-MT300N-V2-Standard-Equipped-Wireless-Performance/dp/B0CNC6DMTN) on Amazon Japan which is, well a rebadged Gl.inet Mango. Two weeks later I finally recieve my mango clone, ready to be a pineapple clone.
