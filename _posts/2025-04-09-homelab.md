# Let's Build a Homelab

Welcome to the caffeine-fueled, late-night chronicles of a homelabber who decided that AWS is nice, but “We Got AWS at Home” is way more fun. This isn’t a roadmap, it’s not a course, and it’s definitely not a copy-paste from some LLM. It’s just me, a desk full of tangled Ethernet cables, and the kind of curiosity that turns a quiet Saturday into a 12-hour Docker troubleshooting session.

Homelabbing, for the uninitiated, is where enterprise tech meets domestic chaos. It’s part science project, part therapy, and part bragging rights. You’re the architect, the sysadmin, the SRE, and, when things go wrong, the janitor. There are no tickets, no permissions, and no one to blame but yourself when you accidentally nuke your DNS at 2AM. And you will. That’s part of the fun.

What actually is a homelab? For me, it started as a simple way to learn real infrastructure—by breaking things and fixing them, not by following some sanitized course. My first “lab” was a Raspberry Pi running Pi-hole, but it quickly escalated. Now, I’ve got a ThinkCentre M700 humming quietly, a Mac Mini pulling media duty, and a Pi cluster doing distributed experiments just because I can. Every device has a name, every cable is labeled (eventually), and every crash is a new story.

Why bother with all this? Because spinning up a VPS is fine, but nothing beats the drama of hearing a hard drive whirr to life under your desk while you stare down a docker-compose file written by your sleep-deprived past self. It’s about total control: no telemetry, no surprise paywalls, no data siphoned off to some faceless SaaS. Everything lives and dies on your terms, powered by your own questionable decisions and a lot of coffee.

The learning is real. You’ll curse at YAML, you’ll question your life choices, and you’ll probably give your NAS a name and start talking to it when things go wrong. But you’ll also pick up networking, storage, Docker, firewalls, and the kind of troubleshooting skills you can’t learn from a YouTube playlist. Every “oops” moment is a case study. Every weird error is a new rabbit hole to dive down. And when you finally get everything working, there’s a satisfaction you just can’t get from clicking “Deploy” on a cloud dashboard.

My advice? Start with what you have. Don’t wait for the perfect server or the ultimate rack. My ThinkCentre cost less than a fancy dinner, but it’s handled everything I’ve thrown at it. Ubuntu Server is my go-to—simple, stable, and just enough pain to keep things interesting. Docker and Docker Compose are the backbone, because nothing says “homelab” like spinning up and tearing down containers at will. And yes, you’ll eventually hate and love YAML in equal measure.

The first thing I set up was AdGuard Home, because nothing says “power move” like blocking ads and trackers for every device on your network. Watching the dashboard rack up blocked requests is a guilty pleasure. Next came Portainer, because as much as I love the CLI, sometimes you just want to see all your containers in one place and click your way out of a mess. Vaultwarden followed, because password managers should be yours—not some cloud service’s honeypot. FileBrowser is my go-to for moving files around, and Nginx Proxy Manager ties it all together with clean URLs and free SSL from Let’s Encrypt.

But the real magic is in the chaos. You’ll break things. You’ll fix things. You’ll learn more from one DNS meltdown than from a dozen tutorials. And when you finally get your stack humming—media server, ad blocker, password vault, and all—you’ll realize you’ve built something that’s actually yours. Not just rented compute in someone else’s cloud, but a living, blinking, sometimes-screaming beast that you control.

There’s no right way to homelab. Some people run everything on a single box. Some build Pi clusters just to see if they can. Some go full enterprise, with racks and patch panels and more UPSes than sense. Me? I pick what’s fun, what’s useful, and what’ll give me the best story for the next meetup.

So if you’re thinking about starting, don’t wait for permission. Don’t wait for the perfect hardware or the perfect guide. Just dive in, break stuff, fix it, and brag about it when you finally get it working. That’s the homelab life—educational, empowering, and just the right amount of unhinged.
