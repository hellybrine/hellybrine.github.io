> "The trusted companion for a home sysadmin "

No roadmaps. No Udemy courses. No LLMs whispering sweet nothings about YAML in my ear. Just a battered mug of filter coffee, a stubborn streak, and the kind of passion that keeps you up at 3AM wiring up VLANs for no good reason except that you can. If you’re looking for a step-by-step guide, this isn’t it. This is the story of how I actually started my lab, what I broke, what I fixed, and what I learned along the way. All powered by caffeine and the eternal quest for bragging rights.

# The Spark

I still remember the first time I typed “how to hack” into YouTube. It was in 12th grade, probably during one of those endless afternoons when you’re supposed to be studying but your mind is itching for something real. What started as a random search quickly turned into a rabbit hole that I’ve never really climbed out of. Hacking, as I came to understand, wasn’t about breaking things just for kicks. It was about understanding systems so well that you could make them do things nobody else had thought of. That sense of curiosity, the urge to poke, prod, and tinker, has never left me.

# Networking: The Secret Language

My first real obsession was networking. The OSI model, TCP/IP, DNS, NAT, UDP, HTTPS—these weren’t just lines in a textbook, they were the secret language of the internet. I spent nights running Wireshark, tracing packets, and setting up VLANs just to see what would break. The more I learned, the more I realized how much was happening under the hood every time I hit enter on a URL. It was like discovering that the world’s biggest magic trick actually had a method, and I could learn it if I just kept digging.

# Building the Playground

That drive to understand and control things is what led to my homelab. I didn’t build it out of necessity or because I was short on resources. I built it because I wanted a playground, a place where I could experiment without worrying about breaking anything important. My first “rig” was a Raspberry Pi running Pi-hole, but it didn’t take long before I wanted more power and flexibility. That’s when the Lenovo ThinkCentre M700 came in, a real workhorse that still surprises me with what it can handle. The Mac Mini joined the party for media and dev work, and the Pi cluster grew for lightweight services and distributed experiments. Cable management became a point of pride, and every blinking LED was there because I put it there.

# Silencing the Digital Noise

The first thing I wanted to fix was the digital noise. Ads, trackers, analytics scripts—they were everywhere, slowing things down and wasting bandwidth. AdGuard Home was the answer. Setting it up was like flipping a switch. Suddenly, websites loaded faster, my phone battery lasted longer, and my network felt clean. It wasn’t just about blocking ads; it was about taking back control. Watching the AdGuard dashboard fill up with blocked requests became my new guilty pleasure. Every time I saw a spike, I knew I’d just dodged another batch of tracking scripts.

# Automation Addiction

Once the basics were sorted, I started thinking about what else I could automate. If I could control my network, why not my home? That’s where Home Assistant entered the story. It started with a smart bulb and a temperature sensor, but soon I was automating everything. Lights that adjusted to the time of day, AC that kicked in when my CPU got too hot, little scripts that let me control things from my phone or watch. Each automation was a mini-hack, a way to make my space work for me. The best part was that it was all local. No cloud, no vendor lock-in, no random company logging my every move. Just pure, hands-on control.

# Media: My Private Netflix

Of course, with great power comes great responsibility—or in my case, the need for great entertainment. I’ve always been a media junkie, and I wanted my own private Netflix. That’s where Plex and Jellyfin came in. Plex is the crowd-pleaser, slick and polished, perfect for sharing with friends who just want to click and play. Jellyfin is my personal playground, open-source and endlessly customizable. Both are fed by the *arr stack: Radarr for movies, Sonarr for TV, Prowlarr for indexers, Jackett for scraping even the most obscure sources. The automation is beautiful. I add a show to Sonarr, it finds the best source, downloads it via qBittorrent, and within minutes it’s ready to stream, perfectly organized. No region locks, no “this content is not available in your country,” just pure, unfiltered media freedom.

# Books and Manga, My Way

But it’s not just about movies and shows. I’m a voracious reader, and I wanted the same level of control over my books and manga. Kavita became my digital library, handling everything from textbooks to comics, syncing my progress across devices. Suwayomi took care of manga, pulling from all the big sources, tracking what I’d read, and making sure I never missed a new chapter. No ads, no popups, no “premium” paywalls—just my collection, exactly how I want it.

# File Management and Academic Survival

As the homelab grew, so did my need for organization. FileBrowser became my remote file manager, letting me access, upload, and organize files from anywhere. It’s not glamorous, but it’s indispensable. Whether I’m sharing code snippets, moving lecture notes, or just grabbing a PDF on the go, FileBrowser makes it effortless.

Speaking of PDFs, Indian academia is basically a never-ending flood of them. Stirling-PDF became my secret weapon—merging, splitting, converting, unlocking, all locally. I’ve saved more group projects and fixed more last-minute submissions with this tool than I care to admit. If you’ve ever tried to combine a dozen scanned PDFs into one clean file at 2AM, you know the pain and the joy of finally getting it right.

# Securing the Empire

With so many services running, security became a priority. Nginx is my silent guardian, reverse proxying traffic, handling SSL, routing requests, and keeping everything organized. Every service gets a clean subdomain, everything is encrypted with Let’s Encrypt, and I sleep better knowing my setup isn’t leaking data all over the internet.

Docker is the glue that holds it all together, but as the stack grew, managing containers via CLI became a chore. Portainer changed the game, giving me a clean UI for managing containers, images, networks, and volumes. Need to restart a service? Click. Need to deploy a new stack? Click. Need to figure out why your RAM usage just spiked to 99%? That still takes some work, but at least I can see all the logs in one place.

Passwords are the bane of every geek’s existence. Vaultwarden became my fortress—long, random, unique passwords for every site and service, synced across devices, and stored on hardware I control. No more password reuse, no more “forgot password” emails, no more worrying about third-party breaches. It’s the kind of peace of mind you don’t realize you need until you have it.

Keeping everything up to date is a full-time job, unless you have Watchtower. It’s my update bot, silently pulling the latest Docker images and keeping everything patched. Sure, sometimes an update breaks something and I get to play “production incident manager” at 3AM, but honestly, that’s half the fun. If you haven’t restored a backup while half-asleep, are you even a sysadmin?

# Monitoring and Utility

With so much running, monitoring became essential. That’s where Beszel and its agent come in. They keep an eye on uptime, resource usage, and alert me if anything goes down. It’s not flashy, but it’s essential for keeping everything running smoothly. Glance pulls all the metrics together into a single dashboard—CPU, RAM, network, temperatures—so I can spot problems before they become disasters.

Some tools are just pure utility. IT-Tools is my Swiss Army knife for everything from encoding to regex testing. Excalidraw is my go-to for network diagrams, automation flows, or just sketching out ideas before I build. These are the little things that make life easier, the digital equivalent of having a screwdriver and a roll of duct tape on hand at all times.

# Looking Back

Looking back, every tool in my homelab is there for a reason. Some solve specific problems, some started as experiments and became essential, and some are just fun to tinker with. But together, they’re more than the sum of their parts. They’re a living, evolving system—a reflection of my curiosity, my need for control, and my love of building things for myself.

Self-hosting isn’t about being anti-cloud or paranoid about privacy, though privacy is a big deal. It’s about independence, about learning, and about the satisfaction of creating something that’s truly yours. It’s about waking up, checking your dashboard, and knowing that every blinking light, every running service, is there because you made it happen.

If you’re just starting out, here’s my advice. Be curious, don’t be afraid to break things, and always keep backups. The Indian tech community is huge, supportive, and always ready to help. And if you ever get stuck, just ask. There’s always someone who’s been there before.

So to the version of me who typed “how to hack” into YouTube for the first time, thanks. I discovered a world that’s deeper, weirder, and more rewarding than I could imagine.
