## Hello World

This blog means a lot to me.

Since my freshman years, I’ve been immersed in **cybersecurity** and **self-hosting** not just as a hobby, but as something I genuinely *live* for. There’s something deeply satisfying about understanding systems, breaking them apart, and building them back up on *my* terms. Whether it's running services on a Raspberry Pi or setting up my own DNS resolver, I’ve always preferred control over convenience, curiosity over convention.

But oddly enough, despite all this time in the terminal, I never had a space to write. No place to share the little wins, the hard-learned lessons, the late-night rabbit holes. I wanted a blog that felt like home. Not a Medium account. Not a Substack. Something I could tweak, break, fix, and own completely.

### Why this setup?

I stumbled upon how well **GitHub Pages** and **Jekyll** integrate, and immediately saw the appeal; Markdown for writing, Git for versioning, and no servers to babysit. Then I found [Hux’s theme](https://github.com/huxpro/huxpro.github.io), and it just *clicked*. Simple, fast, and developer-first. It felt like the kind of blog I’d want to read *and* build.

I’ve since customized it to better reflect who I am, but I owe a lot to Hux’s original work. Without it, I might still be figuring out what font to use or which static site generator to pick.

### What this space is

This is where I’ll document my explorations; security concepts I’m diving into, tools I’m self-hosting, guides I wish existed when I was figuring things out. It’s a bit of a digital garden, a bit of a personal log. No SEO bait, no fluff. Just raw, technical, passionate content.

If you're into breaking things to understand them better, or building infrastructure that answers to *you* and not some faceless SaaS, then maybe you'll find something here that sparks something in you too.

This blog’s just getting started, but it already feels like one of the most *me* things I’ve ever built.
