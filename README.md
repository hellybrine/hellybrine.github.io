# Mac's Blog

> A digital garden on networking, self-hosting, cybersecurity, and whatever I'm hacking on at the moment.

This is the source code for my personal blog, powered by [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) and based on the legendary [Huxpro](https://github.com/huxpro/huxpro.github.io) theme. I'm customizing it to better suit my style and projects â€” including posts on DIY WiFi Pineapples, smart home devices, self-hosted infra, and more.

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

To run the blog locally:

### 1. Install dependencies

You'll need Ruby and Bundler. Once set up:

```bash
bundle install
```

### 2. Serve the site

```bash
bundle exec jekyll serve
```

Visit [http://localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000) to preview it.

## ðŸ›  Development Notes

- Jekyll templates are mostly located in `_layouts/`, `_includes/`, and `_posts/`
- Syntax highlighting is handled via [Rouge](https://github.com/rouge-ruby/rouge)
- Minimal JS/CSS customization for now â€” keeping it clean and performant

If you're customizing your own fork, I recommend checking:

- `_config.yml` â€“ core site settings
- `assets/css/style.scss` â€“ styles
- `_includes/sidebar.html` â€“ for social links
- `_includes/header.html` â€“ for nav

## ðŸ¤˜ About Me

I'm Mac â€” currently studying Software Engineering with a minor in Cyber Forensics. I love self-hosting, messing with networks, building smart devices, and tinkering with tech that most people are scared to touch.

Let me know if you want me to include badges (like for GitHub Pages status), a lighter version, or a deployment section next!
